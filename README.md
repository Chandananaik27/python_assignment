# **1. `calendar_module()`**

- This Python script defines a function `calendar_module()` to determine the day of the week for a given input date.
- It prompts the user to input a date in the format 'MM-DD-YEAR', converts it to a `datetime.date` object, calculates the day of the week using `.weekday()`, and returns the corresponding day in uppercase after logging it.
# ****2. collections_namedtuples()****

* This Python script defines a function calculate_average() to compute the average marks of students. 
* It first reads the number of students, their column names, and calculates the average of marks by summing up marks and dividing by the number of students. 
* The script then logs the result to two decimal places using the logging module.
# **3. `read_student_marks()`**
